To run the code, run the main.py script in the home repository with 3 arguments (Input video, Output Video, Debugging mode)
e.g. python main.py "Data\Video.mp4" "Output\Output.mp4" True 
This will use the video in Data and output the video in directory Output with debugging turned on.
If 3rd argument is ignored or is anything other than True, script runs in normal mode.
